'''
Create an empty dictionary called 'road_trip'

Create a function that takes in two parameters (stop_number and destination)
Use the passed in parameters to update the dictionary
- If the stop_number already exists, print an error message
- If the stop_number does not exist, add the stop_number and destination to the dictinary and print the added values

BONUS: 
Instead of just coding in new values for testing purposes, create a for loop that allows users to enter all details
Instead of printing an error for existing stops, ask the user if they would like to overwrite the existing stop
- If they do, allow them to overwrite the existing stop
